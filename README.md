### Here is What I'm Doing

- I’m currently studying in university and in School 21 (Moscow Campus of Ecole 42)
- I’m learning Pascal & C
- I can set up a really simple server
- I can do some things in GNU/Linux operating systems 
(I know some Ubuntu and dabbled in Debian)
- Ask me about anything!

I mostly upload things I've done in code school here
