- I mostly code in C/C++, currently learning Python and Front-end Web Development
- I can set up a simple server (on Debian with Lighttpd,
MariaDB and PHP; using a webpage made with WordPress, but I know some basics of HTML, CSS and JS as well)
- I can use Linux operating systems (Debian-based - Ubuntu; Arch-based - ArcoLinux, Manjaro)
