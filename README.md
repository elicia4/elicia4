- My primary interests are system administration, Linux, and networking.
- I have mainly used Ubuntu and Arch. <br />I currently use Arco, but I can use other related distros too.
- I know the basics of Docker.
- I can write some simple Bash scripts.
- I use VMs daily (QEMU/Virt Manager).
- I can set up the majority of modern Linux distributions.
- I can set up a simple server (on Debian with Lighttpd or on Ubuntu with Apache, I know <br />and used a tiny bit of MariaDB and PHP).
- I know some basic C, C++, Python, Pascal, HTML, CSS, and JS. 
- I can code some primitive graphics and games.
