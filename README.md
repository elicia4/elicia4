- My primary interests are system administration, Linux and networking.
- I have mainly used Ubuntu and Arch (mainly ArcoLinux, but I can use other related distros too).
- I know the basics of Docker.
- I can write some simple bash scripts.
- I use VM's daily.
- I can install and set up pretty much any mainstream Linux distribution.
- I can set up a simple server (on Debian with Lighttpd/on Ubuntu with Apache,
MariaDB and PHP).

- I can code some primitive graphics and games.
